> The European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, 
> commonly referred to as the European Southern Observatory (ESO), 
> is an intergovernmental research organisation made up of 16 member states for ground-based astronomy. 
> 
> Created in 1962, ESO has provided astronomers 
> with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the southern sky. 
> 
> The organisation employs over 750 staff members 
> and receives annual member state contributions of approximately €162 million. 
> Its observatories are located in northern Chile.
>
> ESO has built and operated some of the largest and most technologically advanced telescopes. 
> These include the 3.6 m New Technology Telescope, an early pioneer in the use of active optics, 
> and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which consists of four individual 8.2 m telescopes 
> and four smaller auxiliary telescopes which can all work together or separately. 
> 
> The Atacama Large Millimeter Array 
> observes the universe in the millimetre and submillimetre wavelength ranges, 
> and is the world's largest ground-based astronomy project to date. 
> 
> It was completed in March 2013 in an international collaboration by Europe (represented by ESO), 
> North America, East Asia and Chile.
>
> Currently under construction is the Extremely Large Telescope. 
> It will use a 39.3-metre-diameter segmented mirror, 
> and become the world's largest optical reflecting telescope 
> when operational towards the end of the 2020s. 
> 
> Its light-gathering power will allow detailed studies of planets around other stars, 
> the first objects in the universe, supermassive black holes, 
> and the nature and distribution of the dark matter and dark energy which dominate the universe.
>
> ESO's observing facilities have made astronomical discoveries 
> and produced several astronomical catalogues. 
> 
> Its findings include the discovery of the most distant gamma-ray burst 
> and evidence for a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. 
> 
> In 2004, the VLT allowed astronomers to obtain 
> the first picture of an extrasolar planet (2M1207b) orbiting a brown dwarf 173 light-years away. 
> 
> The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument 
> installed on the older ESO 3.6 m telescope led to the discovery of extrasolar planets, 
> including Gliese 581c—one of the smallest planets seen outside the Solar System.
