> Salvador Guillermo Allende Gossens (26 June 1908 – 11 September 1973) 
> was a Chilean socialist politician who served as the 28th president of Chile 
> from 1970 until his death in 1973. 
> 
> As a socialist committed to democracy, he has been described as 
> the first Marxist to be elected president in a liberal democracy in Latin America.
>
> Allende's involvement in Chilean politics spanned a period of nearly forty years, 
> during which he held various positions including senator, deputy, and cabinet minister. 
> 
> As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile, 
> whose foundation he had actively contributed to, 
> he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. 
> 
> In 1970, he won the presidency as the candidate of the Popular Unity coalition 
> in a close three-way race. 
> 
> He was elected in a run-off by Congress, as no candidate had gained a majority. 
> In office, Allende pursued a policy he called "The Chilean Path to Socialism". 
> The coalition government was far from unanimous. 
> 
> Allende said that he was committed to democracy 
> and represented the more moderate faction of the Socialist Party, 
> while the radical wing sought a more radical course. 
> Instead, the Communist Party of Chile favored a gradual and cautious approach 
> that sought cooperation with Christian democrats, 
> which proved influential for the Italian Communist Party and the Historic Compromise.
>
> As president, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education, 
> and improve the living standards of the working class. 
> 
> He clashed with the right-wing parties that controlled Congress and with the judiciary. 
> 
> On 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état 
> supported by the CIA, which initially denied the allegations. 
> 
> In 2000, the CIA admitted its role in the 1970 kidnapping of General René Schneider 
> who had refused to use the army to stop Allende's inauguration. 
> 
> Declassified documents released in 2023 showed that US president Richard Nixon, 
> his national security advisor Henry Kissinger, and the United States government, 
> which had branded Allende as a "dangerous" communist, 
> were aware of the military's plans to overthrow Allende's democratically elected government
>  in the days before the coup d'état. 
>  
>  As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, Allende gave his last speech vowing not to resign. 
>  Later that day, Allende died by suicide in his office; the exact circumstances of his death are still disputed.
>
> Following Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet 
> refused to return authority to a civilian government, 
> and Chile was later ruled by the Government Junta, 
> ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance, 
> a period known as the Presidential Republic. 
> 
> The military junta that took over dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution of 1925, 
> and initiated a program of persecuting alleged dissidents, 
> in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed. 
> 
> Pinochet's military dictatorship only ended after the successful internationally backed 1989 constitutional referendum led to the peaceful Chilean transition to democracy.
