> **Valparaíso** (English:  val-pə-RAY-soh  or ; Spanish: [balpaɾaˈiso]) is a major city, 
> commune, seaport, and naval base facility in the Valparaíso Region of Chile. 
> Valparaíso was originally named after Valparaíso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain.
>
> Greater Valparaíso is the second-most populous metro area in the country. 
> Valparaiso is the second-largest city in the metro area (behind Viña del Mar).  
> 
> It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, 
> and is one of the Pacific Ocean's most important seaports. 
> 
> Valparaíso is the capital of Chile's second most-populated administrative region 
> and has been the Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, 
> as well as being the seat of the National Congress of Chile since 1990.
>
> Valparaíso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century 
> when it served as a major stopover for ships 
> traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via the Straits of Magellan. 
> 
> The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age 
> as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors 
> as "Little San Francisco" and "jewel of the Pacific". 
> 
> Notable developments during this bustling period include 
> - Latin America's oldest stock exchange, 
> - the continent's first volunteer fire department, 
> - Chile's first public library, and 
> - the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valparaíso. 
> 
> In 2003, the historic quarter of Valparaíso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
>
> The twentieth century was unfavorable to Valparaíso, 
> as many wealthy families abandoned the city. 
> 
> The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, 
> dealt a serious blow to the region's shipping- and port-based economy. 
> 
> By the 21st century, the port of San Antonio had surpassed Valparaíso 
> in trade volume (TEU) handled, leading to the questioning of 
> its traditional moniker of Puerto Principal ("principal port") of Chile.
>
> Between 2000 and 2015, the city experienced a recovery, 
> attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, 
> who settled after they were attracted by the city's hillside historic districts. 
> 
> Today, many thousands of people visit Valparaíso each month, from Chile and abroad 
> to enjoy the city's labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. 
> 
> The Port of Valparaíso still continues to be a major distribution center 
> for container traffic, copper, and fruit exports. 
> 
> It also receives growing attention from cruise ships 
> that visit during the South American summer. 
> 
> Most significantly, Valparaíso has transformed itself into 
> a major educational and entertainment hub, 
> with four large traditional universities, and several large vocational colleges.
>
> While the city is well-known for its artisans and bohemian culture, 
> it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. 
> 
> The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual Viña Del Mar International Song Festival (often simply called "Viña" or "Viña Del Mar"). 
> Typically held in March, in a recently refurbished, 40,000-capacity amphitheater, 
> "Viña" is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, 
> as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers 
> will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. 
> 
> In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, 
> and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and live-streamed festival 
> is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds.
