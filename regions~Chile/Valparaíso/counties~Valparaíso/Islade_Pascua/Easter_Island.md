> Easter Island (Spanish: Isla de Pascua, [ˈizla ðe ˈpaskwa]; Rapa Nui: Rapa Nui, [ˈɾapa ˈnu.i]) 
> is an island and special territory of Chile in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, 
> at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania. 
> 
> The island is renowned for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called moai, 
> which were created by the early Rapa Nui people. 
> In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, 
> with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. 
> Easter Island is also the only territory in Polynesia where Spanish is an official language.
>
> Experts differ on when the island's Polynesian inhabitants first reached the island. 
> While many researchers cited evidence that they arrived around the year 800, 
> a 2007 study provided compelling evidence suggesting their arrival was closer to 1200. 
> The inhabitants created a thriving and industrious culture, 
> as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone moai and other artifacts. 
> Land clearing for cultivation 
> and the introduction of the Polynesian rat led to gradual deforestation. 
> 
> By the time of European arrival in 1722, 
> the island's population was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000. 
> European diseases, Peruvian slave raiding expeditions in the 1860s, 
> and emigration to other islands such as Tahiti further depleted the population, 
> reducing it to a low of 111 native inhabitants in 1877.
>
> Chile annexed Easter Island in 1888. 
> In 1966, the Rapa Nui were granted Chilean citizenship. 
> In 2007, the island gained the constitutional status of "special territory"(Spanish: territorio especial). 
> Administratively, it belongs to the Valparaíso Region, 
> constituting a single commune (Isla de Pascua) of the Province of Isla de Pascua. 
> The 2017 Chilean census registered 7,750 people on the island, 
> of which 3,512 (45%) identified as Rapa Nui.
>
> Easter Island is one of the world's most remote inhabited islands. 
> The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) 
> is Pitcairn Island, 2,075 kilometres (1,289 mi) away; 
> the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, 
> on the island of Mangareva, 2,606 km (1,619 mi) away; 
> the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, 3,512 km (2,182 mi) away.
